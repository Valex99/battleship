Battleship Game ðŸš¢ðŸŽ¯

A classic Battleship game built with JavaScript using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The game follows core OOP principles, separating game logic from the DOM. Players take turns attacking enemy grids, with the computer making random moves. The game ends when all ships on one board are sunk.
